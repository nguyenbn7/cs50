#C++
## Introduction
**C++**  is a [general-purpose programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_programming_language) created by [Bjarne Stroustrup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup) as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms
